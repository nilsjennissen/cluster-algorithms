# Cluster Algorithm Project

This project involves using multiple cluster algorithms on a given dataset to find the optimal cluster algorithm. The project is intended to give insights into finding the best clustering algorithm for a given dataset.

### 🧭 Project Overview

This project follows the following tasks:

1. Load data into the project environment
2. Prepare the data for clustering by performing feature engineering and normalization
3. Cluster the data using multiple algorithms such as K-Means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative, Spectral Clustering, etc.
4. Evaluate each clustering algorithm using appropriate metrics and choose the optimal one
5. Visualize the clustering results and export the clusters as a CSV file for further analysis

### ⏱️ Estimated time needed: 4h

Note: That the time estimation may vary due to your setup and previous experience.

### 🚧 Prerequisites

Before running this project, you must have the following:

1. Python 3 installed on your system
2. Knowledge of clustering algorithms
